#  $\ hat{p}$

This is repository for quantum information resources that I find interesting.

p_hat is the momentum operator in quantum mechanics.

In the same vein as (Coding Train)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw] and similar YouTube channels,
this repository is meant to organize my learning of quantum physics and quantum computing.

I hope to also write code, make videos, and continue to grow the potential educational impact of this repository.

I am open to all suggestions and would love to start building a community.
