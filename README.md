# *p&#770;*

This is repository for quantum information resources.

p&#770; is the momentum operator in quantum mechanics.

In the same vein as [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and similar YouTube channels,
this repository is meant to organize my learning of quantum physics and quantum computing.

I hope to also write code, make videos, and continue to grow the potential educational impact of this repository.

I am open to all suggestions and would love to start building a community.
