# *p&#770;*
p&#770; is the momentum operator in quantum mechanics.

This is a repository primarily made for the UChicago Quantum Society RSO.
I hope to write code, make videos, and continue to grow the potential educational impact of this repository.

I am open to all suggestions and would love to start building a community, not just for UChicago students.
