We are a group of quantum computing enthusiasts interested in forming an RSO to engage undergrads in the field through talks, lab-tours, and hackathons.
UChicago has an amazing group of faculty in this field doing interesting research from algorithm design to new qubit designs **.
If you would like to help in starting this with us, please fill out the google form and come to our meetings.
