# Application for UChicago RSO

### 1. *What current RSOs have a similar purpose or goals to your organization?  How is your organization different from those organizations?*

The UChicago Quantum Society looks to bring students together from disparate backgrounds in order not to teach them one curriculum, but rather present legitimate and contempory problems in quantum computing that capitalize on their specialized backgrounds. We believe there is a great deal of impactful research being conducted on UChicago's campus in the field of quantum computing, but there is not a well established avenue for students to engage with the field. The UChicago Quantum Society will provide this infrastructure through quarterly talks from prominent faculty, lab and facility tours on campus, and larger educational workshops. While we currently envision a more scientific oriented set of events, this cutting edge research also allows opportunities for discussion in policy, ethics, and philosophical contexts.

While we share some of the broader objectives of other STEM academic clubs such as the Engineering Society, CS Student Activities Council, Math Club, Tiger Talks, and Benzene, none currently encapsulate what we believe the UChicago Quantum Society can achieve. The UChicago Quantum Society is specifically focused on quantum computing and quantum information. This distinction is important because the principles of quantum computing require a uniquely interdisciplinary set of fields involving physics, computer science, chemistry, materials science, math, and engineering.

### 2. How would your organization benefit from RSO status?  List specific Center for Leadership and Involvement or University resources that you would hope to utilize that would only be available to your organization if it becomes an RSO.

The UChicago Quantum Society would gain greatly through attaining RSO status. Our current agenda contains weekly meetings in the Regenstein Library's private rooms. Through being an RSO, we would gain consistent access to rooms that would 



The two primary benefits that RSO status provides is better access to facilities for holding meetings and providing easier and more effective communication with faculty and students.

Access to University facilities will help us to host hack sessions and lectures.

Having a location on campus to meet will enable us to grow our club and minimize logistical problems unrelated to the goals of the RSO. 

These resources will also help grow the community on campus and get people engaged in the field in a way that being a private, off-campus social club would not.

### 3. Describe any events and meetings that your organization has held so far and your plans for the future.

During the first few weeks, the VP, Treasurer, and I met in our current location (JRL 403) on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Starting 6th week, we started publicizing these meetings and made them once a week on Wednesday, with a biweekly meeting on Monday for working on administrative tasks.

We had more than 10 people attend the first of these meetings, and have maintained a weekly attendance of 5-6 people.

We've met with our club advisor, Andrew Cleland, and discussed how to begin recruitment and outreach, which since then, we have sent out an email to the CS undergraduate listhost. 

We currently have over 50 members in our Facebook group, and a similar number subscribed to our listhost.

### Priority Queue of goals for Winter 2020:

	1. Host at least one faculty lecture where people can come hear field experts talk about their work.
	
	2. Host weekly meetings to discuss recent developments in the field.
	
	3. Host a hackathon where people can begin to learn to write quantum algorithms.
	
	4. Take students on a tour of a lab where quantum computing research is being done.

### 4. How would your organization use its RSO status to benefit the University community and/or greater community?

The UChicago Quantum Society would be an asset to the University in helping communicate the importance of quantum computing and the PME's resources. Moreover, if UCQuantum were granted RSO status, it would enable us to more easily garner interaction from faculty, which is essential for the kind of events we want to host. We believe that these events have the potential to enervate the existing community surrounding quantum computing and molecular engineering on campus, as well as grow the community.

As evinced by the high number of responses to the interest poll we sent to the CS department mailing list, there is a lot of interest surrounding quantum computing amongst the undergraduate population. However, there is not a student-led organization to provide for people to meet and exchange ideas. UCQuantum would satisfy this need.

Additionally, many of the official University resources concerning QC require taking a prohibitive amount of prerequisite  courses, UCQ would be a way for people to get involved without any former knowledge.

### 5. If granted recognition, how do plan to make sure that your organization will still be active in 5 years?

I have no doubt that the interest in quantum computing and the need for a corresponding student organization will follow the growth trend that the field has experienced.

Crucial to ensuring a long lasting club will be establishing consistent and fun traditions that students and faculty look forward to. 

Even if we are just hosting our regular meetings, making them as receptive to new ideas and fun as possible will be a significant step towards becoming an institution on campus. 

Sufficient advertising and event planning will be other necessary components of a lasting organization.
I believe that many of the faculty in the field are going to be open to talking to student that are interested.


### 6. Please list any anticipated risks associated with operating this RSO (i.e. equipment, travel, etc.). How would you work to minimize these risks?

I believe that there is minimal risk in the goals and functions of Momentum that I have written about prior.

The primary risks that I foresee would be possibly mishandling of projectors when faculty/students give talks. 

I plan on minimizing these risks by trying to only use these materials when necessary (large groups) and opting for more DIY solutions or not using presentation equipment and using the chalkboards.

Since off-campus events require a significantly more logistics and planning, I plan to host all events on-campus at this time.
