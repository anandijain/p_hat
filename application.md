# Application for UChicago RSO

### 1. *What current RSOs have a similar purpose or goals to your organization?  How is your organization different from those organizations?*

There are multiple academic clubs that have similar broad objectives to host talks, workshops, lab tours for different academic fields.

We have a similar organization outlook as: Engineering Society, CS Student Activities Council, Math Club, Tiger Talks, and Benzene.
 
UChicago Quantum Society is specifically focused on quantum computing and quantum information. 

This distinction is important because the principles of quantum computing requires a different knowledge set and involves the work of physics, computer science, and engineering.

The disciplines that this new technology brings together spans multiple departments and engaging these faculty with interested undergraduates will be a positive force for rigorous and devoted research.

### 2. How would your organization benefit from RSO status?  List specific Center for Leadership and Involvement or University resources that you would hope to utilize that would only be available to your organization if it becomes an RSO.

The two primary benefits that RSO status provides is better access to facilities for holding meetings and providing easier and more effective communication with faculty and students.

Access to University facilities will help us to host hack sessions and lectures.

Having a location on campus to meet will enable us to grow our club and minimize logistical problems unrelated to the goals of the RSO. 

These resources will also help grow the community on campus and get people engaged in the field in a way that being a private, off-campus social club would not.

### 3. Describe any events and meetings that your organization has held so far and your plans for the future.

The VP, Treasurer, and I have been meeting in our current location (Reg 403 subject to change) on Monday and Wednesdays throughout this quarter.

We met with our club advisor, Andrew Cleland, and discussed how to begin recruitment and outreach, which since then, we have sent out an email to the CS undergraduate listhost. Additionally, though sharing on facebook have 25 students 

We either will reach out to professors 

### Priority Queue of goals for 2019 Autumn:

	1. Host weekly club meetings where we follow the book 'Quantum Computing and Quantum Information' by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang.
 
	* I want the club to be primarily an introduction to the field for members, who most likely will not have a lot of experience in quantum computing.

	2. Host at least one faculty lecture where they talk about their work and the challenges they face.

	3. Tour a lab. 

### 4. How would your organization use its RSO status to benefit the University community and/or greater community?

The UChicago Quantum Society would be an asset to the University in helping communicate the importance of quantum computing and the PME's resources. We (UChicago) are poised to be leaders in quantum networking (Fermi <-> Argonne's quantum superhighway) and I believe that many students would be interested in this if there were more resources for non-PME/physics students.

I am a computer science student and I believe that many other CS students are interested in the massive speedup that quantum computing allows for, but there is not a student-led organization to provide for people to meet and exchange ideas. 

Many of the official University resources to get involved in quantum computing require prerequisite knowledge and courses, this would be a way for people to get involved without any former knowledge.

One of the primary goals of the club is to be as open to people outside the UChicago community as possible by creating educational content for everyone. This will reflect the administration's focus on quantum engineering and show it from the side of excited students. 

I think that the creation of an online quantum community will be a fantastic asset for UChicago and the PME.

### 5. If granted recognition, how do plan to make sure that your organization will still be active in 5 years?

I have no doubt that the interest in quantum computing and the need for a corresponding student organization will follow the growth trend that the field has experienced.

Crucial to ensuring a long lasting club will be establishing consistent and fun traditions that students and faculty look forward to. 

Even if we are just hosting our regular meetings, making them as receptive to new ideas and fun as possible will be a significant step towards becoming an institution on campus. 

Sufficient advertising and event planning will be other necessary components of a lasting organization.
I believe that many of the faculty in the field are going to be open to talking to student that are interested.


### 6. Please list any anticipated risks associated with operating this RSO (i.e. equipment, travel, etc.). How would you work to minimize these risks?

I believe that there is minimal risk in the goals and functions of Momentum that I have written about prior.

The primary risks that I foresee would be possibly mishandling of projectors when faculty/students give talks. 

I plan on minimizing these risks by trying to only use these materials when necessary (large groups) and opting for more DIY solutions or not using presentation equipment and using the chalkboards.

Since off-campus events require a significantly more logistics and planning, I plan to host all events on-campus at this time.
