Application for UChicago RSO

1. What current RSOs have a similar purpose or goals to your organization?  How is your organization different from those organizations?

There are multiple academic clubs that have similar broad objectives (host talks, workshops, lab tours).
We have a similar organization outlook as: Engineering Society, CS Student Activities Council, Math Club, Tiger Talks, and Benzene. 
UChicago Quantum Society, however, is specifically focused on quantum computing and quantum information. 
This distinction is important because the 


2. How would your organization benefit from RSO status?  List specific Center for Leadership and Involvement or University resources that you would hope to utilize that would only be available to your organization if it becomes an RSO.

One of the key benefits that an RSO status will enable Momentum to achieve is effective communication with faculty by hosting talks and events on campus. 

Free/reduced cost reservations of University facilities will help us to host hack sessions to learn about quantum mechanics, learning to code quantum algorithms in python packages like Cirq (by google), or the quantum tools that our own EPiQC has built.

These resources will also help grow the community on campus and get people engaged in the field in a way that being a private, off-campus social club would not.


3. Describe any events and meetings that your organization has held so far and your plans for the future.

We currently exist as a messenger group chat (we now have a slack) that is basically a journal club for sharing cool links and projects found online.


4. How would your organization use its RSO status to benefit the University community and/or greater community?

Momentum would be an asset to the University in helping communicate the importance of quantum computing and the PME's resources. We are poised to be leaders in quantum networking (Fermi <-> Argonne's quantum superhighway) and I believe that many students would be interested in this if there were more resources for non-PME/physics students.

I am a computer science student and I believe that many other CS students are interested in the massive speedup that quantum computing allows for, but there is not a student-led organization to provide for people to meet and exchange ideas.

One of the primary goals of the club is to be as open to people outside the UChicago community as possible by creating educational content for everyone. This will reflect the administration's focus on quantum engineering and show it from the side of excited students. 

I think that the creation of an online quantum community will be a fantastic asset for UChicago and the PME.

5. If granted recognition, how do plan to make sure that your organization will still be active in 5 years?

I have no doubt that the interest in quantum computing and the need for a corresponding student organization will follow the growth trend that the field has experienced.

Hosting weekly meetings, even if there is not a talk/event that week, for sharing thoughts on new papers or ideas will be crucial in starting the traditions that a long term club uses to maintain Momentum. 

Sufficient advertising and event planning will be other necesary components of a lasting organization. I believe that many of the faculty in the field are going to be open to talking to student that are interested.

6. Please list any anticipated risks associated with operating this RSO (i.e. equipment, travel, etc.). How would you work to minimize these risks?

I believe that there is minimal risk in the goals and functions of Momentum that I have written about prior.

The primary risks that I forsee would be possibly mishandling of projectors when faculty/students give talks. 

I plan on minimizing these risks by trying to only use these materials when necessary (large groups) and opting for more DIY solutions or not using presentation equipment and using the chalkboards.
