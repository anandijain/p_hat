# Application for UChicago RSO

### 1. *What current RSOs have a similar purpose or goals to your organization?  How is your organization different from those organizations?*

The UChicago Quantum Society looks to bring students together from disparate backgrounds in order not to teach them one curriculum, but rather present legitimate and contempory problems in quantum computing that capitalize on their specialized backgrounds. We believe there is a great deal of impactful research being conducted on UChicago's campus in the field of quantum computing, but there is not a well established avenue for students to engage with the field. The UChicago Quantum Society will provide this infrastructure through quarterly talks from prominent faculty, lab and facility tours on campus, and larger educational workshops. While we currently envision a more scientific oriented set of events, this cutting edge research also allows opportunities for discussion in policy, ethics, and philosophical contexts.

While we share some of the broader objectives of other STEM academic clubs such as the Engineering Society, CS Student Activities Council, Math Club, Tiger Talks, and Benzene, none currently encapsulate what we believe the UChicago Quantum Society can achieve. The UChicago Quantum Society is specifically focused on quantum computing and quantum information. This distinction is important because the principles of quantum computing require a uniquely interdisciplinary set of fields involving physics, computer science, chemistry, materials science, math, and engineering.

### 2. How would your organization benefit from RSO status?  List specific Center for Leadership and Involvement or University resources that you would hope to utilize that would only be available to your organization if it becomes an RSO.

The UChicago Quantum Society would gain greatly through attaining RSO status. Our current agenda contains weekly meetings that are hosted wherever we can find space. Through being an RSO, we would gain consistent access to rooms in the Regenstein Library that would allow a more regular schedule to be held. Similarly, for our larger planned events, such as our hackathon and faculty talks, we will need an official means of reserving space. Our hope is to create a society that is not just a loose collection of students this year, but a community that sustains itself for many years to come.

Having official RSO status will also provide us with a legitamacy that otherwise we would not have access to. The perception of our group, by faculty, off-campus groups, and students, will depend greatly on our validity. Having the University's approval will remove some barrier of communication we currently face as an unregistered collective. Students will also be more interested in joining an established society with a strong infrastructure and access to resources that allow more creativity in what our club can accomplish.

### 3. Describe any events and meetings that your organization has held so far and your plans for the future.

In order to begin the process of planning out the club, the VP, the Treasurer, and the President met weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays for the first 6 weeks. This allowed us to craft the bylaws, the general mission of the club, and the blueprint for the remaining quarter. Starting 6th week, we publicized these meetings and made them once a week on Wednesday, with a biweekly meeting on Monday for adminsistrative tasks. We consistnetly have had roughly 10 students at the weekly meetings which have consisted of tutorials on the basics of quantum computing, current research endevaurs on and off campus, and exploring news about quantum computing. Different students have lead each week creating a great atmosphere of students bringing in their personal interests and sharing it with the group. 

As current means of outreach, we have sent out an email to the CS undergraduate listhost which garnered over 50 students joining our Facebook group and listhost. We have reached out to the physics department with a similar goal in mind, but they expressed their desire for us to be an actual RSO before they send out our interest form.

The club advisor, Andrew Cleland, has been an invaluable resource for us. With his help, he has given us guidance for how best to communicate with the various departments we are interested in engaging with as well as suggesting feasible projects we could pursue. Looking ahead, we are currently in conversation with Professor William Fefferman about him giving a lecture for us.
### Priority Queue of goals for Winter 2020:

	1. Host at least two faculty lecture where people can come hear field experts talk about their work.
	
	2. Host weekly meetings to discuss recent developments in the field.
	
	3. Host a hackathon where people can begin to learn to write quantum algorithms.
	
	4. Take students on a tour of a lab where quantum computing research is being done.

### 4. How would your organization use its RSO status to benefit the University community and/or greater community?

The UChicago Quantum Society would be an asset to the University in helping communicate the importance of quantum computing and the PME's resources. Moreover, if UCQuantum were granted RSO status, it would enable us to more easily garner interaction from faculty, which is essential for the kind of events we want to host. We believe that these events have the potential to enervate the existing community surrounding quantum computing and molecular engineering on campus, as well as grow the community.

As evinced by the high number of responses to the interest poll we sent to the CS department mailing list, there is a lot of interest surrounding quantum computing amongst the undergraduate population. However, there is not a student-led organization to provide for people to meet and exchange ideas. UCQuantum would satisfy this need.

Additionally, many of the official University resources concerning QC require taking a prohibitive amount of prerequisite  courses, UCQ would be a way for people to get involved without any former knowledge.

### 5. If granted recognition, how do plan to make sure that your organization will still be active in 5 years?

I have no doubt that the interest in quantum computing and the need for a corresponding student organization will follow the growth trend that the field has experienced.

Crucial to ensuring a long lasting club will be establishing consistent and fun traditions that students and faculty look forward to. 

Even if we are just hosting our regular meetings, making them as receptive to new ideas and fun as possible will be a significant step towards becoming an institution on campus. 

Sufficient advertising and event planning will be other necessary components of a lasting organization.
I believe that many of the faculty in the field are going to be open to talking to student that are interested.


### 6. Please list any anticipated risks associated with operating this RSO (i.e. equipment, travel, etc.). How would you work to minimize these risks?

I believe that there is minimal risk in the goals and functions of Momentum that I have written about prior.

The primary risks that I foresee would be possibly mishandling of projectors when faculty/students give talks. 

I plan on minimizing these risks by trying to only use these materials when necessary (large groups) and opting for more DIY solutions or not using presentation equipment and using the chalkboards.

Since off-campus events require a significantly more logistics and planning, I plan to host all events on-campus at this time.
