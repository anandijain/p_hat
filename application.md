# Application for UChicago RSO

### 1. *What current RSOs have a similar purpose or goals to your organization?  How is your organization different from those organizations?*

The UChicago Quantum Society aims to bring together a community of students that are interested in approaching legitimate and contempory problems in quantum computing and quantum information. in ways that capitalize on their specialized backgrounds. We believe there is a great deal of impactful research being conducted at the University of Chicago in the field of quantum computing, but there is not a well established avenue for students to engage with the field. The UChicago Quantum Society will provide this infrastructure through quarterly talks from prominent faculty, lab and facility tours on campus, and larger educational workshops. While we currently have a more science focused outlook, this cutting edge research also opens up opportunity for discussion in policy, ethical, and philosophical contexts.

While we share some of the broader objectives of other STEM academic clubs such as the Engineering Society, CS Student Activities Council, Math Club, Tiger Talks, and Benzene, none currently encapsulate what we believe the UChicago Quantum Society can achieve. The UChicago Quantum Society is specifically focused on quantum computing and quantum information. This distinction is important because the principles of quantum computing require a uniquely interdisciplinary set of fields involving physics, computer science, chemistry, materials science, math, and engineering.

### 2. How would your organization benefit from RSO status?  List specific Center for Leadership and Involvement or University resources that you would hope to utilize that would only be available to your organization if it becomes an RSO.

The UChicago Quantum Society stands to gain singificantly from attaining RSO status. Our current agenda contains weekly meetings that are hosted wherever we can find space. RSO status gains us regular and consistent access to rooms in the Regenstein Library or other buildings on campus that would simplify the process of hosting weekly meetings. Similarly, for our larger planned events, such as our hackathon and faculty talks, we will need an official means of reserving larger spaces. Our hope is to create a society that is not just a loose collection of students this year, but a community that sustains itself for many years to come.

Official RSO status also grants the UChicago Quantum Society name an air of legitimacy that we otherwise lack. Our ability to proliferate the presence of our group amongst faculty, off-campus groups, and students hinges greatly on the legitimacy of our organization. Having the University's approval will remove some barriers of communication we currently face as an unregistered collective. Students will also be more interested in joining an established society with a strong infrastructure and access to resources expands the scope of what our club can accomplish.

### 3. Describe any events and meetings that your organization has held so far and your plans for the future.

During the early weeks of the quarter, the VP, the Treasurer, and the President met weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays. Starting 6th week, we publicized these meetings and made them once a week on Wednesday, with a biweekly meeting on Monday for adminsistrative tasks. We consistnetly have had roughly 10 students at the weekly meetings which have consisted of tutorials on the basics of quantum computing, current research endevaurs on and off campus, and exploring news about quantum computing. Different students have lead each week's meeting, which has created a wonderfully collaborative atmosphere of students bringing and sharing their own personal interests and knowledge. 

One key means of outreach for us has been email: we sent out an email to the CS undergraduate listhost which garnered a large spike in interest, bringing membership on our listhost and Facebook group to over 50 students. We have reached out to the physics department with a similar goal in mind, but they expressed their desire for us to be an actual RSO before they send out our interest form.

One of our main objectives since the inception of the club has been to hold a faculty talk on campus. Near the middle of the quarter, we sat down with Andrew Cleland, the club advisor, to discuss strategies for how to acheive this goal, as well as ensure the success of the club in other ways. With Cleland's help, we've assebled a list of potential speakers to whom we've already began to reach out, in hopes of hosting a talk early next quarter.

### Priority Queue of goals for Winter 2020:

	1. Host at least two faculty lecture where people can come hear field experts talk about their work.
	
	2. Host weekly meetings to discuss recent developments in the field.
	
	3. Host a hackathon where people can begin to learn to write quantum algorithms.
	
	4. Take students on a tour of a lab where quantum computing research is being done.

### 4. How would your organization use its RSO status to benefit the University community and/or greater community?

The UChicago Quantum Society would be an asset to the University in helping communicate the importance of quantum computing as an intensely complex scientific as well as societal problem. With RSO status, our goal is to create infrastrucuture between faculty, industry, and students on campus centered around quantum computing. This would enable more students becoming involved in research on and off campus, greater educational resources being developed as we create curriculum for a broad community, and potential jobs and internships with resources we gather together. We believe that these events have the potential to enervate the existing community surrounding quantum computing and molecular engineering on campus as well as engage students more directly.

Additionally, many of the official University resources in the physics and molecular engineering departments concerning quantum computing require a large amount of prerequisites. We believe this is prohibitive to many students not majoring in either of these majors who would otherwise have a great deal of interest in learning about and particpating in quantum computing. The UChicago Quantum Society would be a way for individuals to get involved with just an interest, drive, and passion for learning. With this as our core tenant as a community, that anyone who wants to participate can and should, we hope to be an arbiter of open scientific discourse.

### 5. If granted recognition, how do plan to make sure that your organization will still be active in 5 years?

Quantum computing, as a relativitly new field of study, has only grown in the last 10 years. More and more is there news in the popular media about the wonders and accomplishments of modern quantum computing. This interest will do nothing but grow for the foreseeable future. As such, we fully expect our club to gain popularity as more students enter the university with both a popular and specialized understanding of quantum computing. This makes it imperative we gain RSO status earlier rather than later so we can have established a certain amount of infrastructure as an organization that can account for rapidly expanding interest in the field.

Crucial to ensuring a long lasting club will be establishing consistent traditions that students and faculty look forward to. The UChicago Quantum Society's weekly meetings are a prime example of this goal. We look to make these weekly meetings as engaging as possible, but more importantly open and available to all students. As iterated many times in this document, quantum computing is a uniquely interdisiplinary field that needs individuals from all backgrounds. One way to ensure the continuing success is to encourage members to shape the activities and projects we engage in. This fluidity has already been demonstrated through our clubs expanding interest in the physical side of quantum computation, as the original plan was to focus more on the computational side initially.

Sufficient advertising and event planning will be other necessary components of a lasting organization. Our listhost, facebook page, slack, and website all are currently being utilized to best establish ourselves with a positive connotation. We also are looking to establish roles on the board in which the tasks of running the club are more explcitly divided such as dividing up internal and external communications.

Finally, there will always be quantum computing resources on campus. The Chicago Quantum Exchange is a world class forum for high level research being performed in the great Chicago and midwest area. SOMETHING ABOUT RESERACH ALWAYS BEING HERE AND STUDENT/FACULTY RELATIONSHIPS


### 6. Please list any anticipated risks associated with operating this RSO (i.e. equipment, travel, etc.). How would you work to minimize these risks?

Like any club, there are inherent risks to our organization we must remain diligent about, but none are prohibitive to the greater success of a safe UChicago Quantum Society. Our organization hopes to participate in laboratory tours as well as physical experiments involving potentially hazourdous materials. As a preventative measure, we will only look to engage with these events through well established avenues like the Physics and Molecular Engineering departments. A lab tour will only occur after very clearly asking a faculty member their expectations and wants in regards to our interest in their research. Similarly, we will not attempt any experiments on our own without clear guidance from our club advisor or a similar authority. These risks are not to be taken lightly but entirely managable if we give them their due forthought.

The current plan is to host all events on-campus as to reduce logistical and minimze possible complications. Eventually, we would love to explore beyond the UChicago campus to the incredible national labs or private companies that reside in the greater Chicago area. This will present new logistical challenges in ensuring a safe environment between traveling and visiting off campus sites. In order to minimize risks, we plan to require a great deal of planning and communication between all parties participating in off campus events and, if necessary, limit the number of students that are able to attend such events
